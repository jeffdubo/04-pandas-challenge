Written Report

This report summarizes data for a district comprised of 15 high schools serving a total of 39,170 students. The school data included the type of school (district or charter), the number of students and the annual budget but did not indicate the time period represented by the data. The student data included the studentâ€™s full name, gender, grade and scores for reading and math but provided no information regarding the source of those scores or other student demographics.

At the district level, the mean math and reading scores were 78.99 and 81.88 respectively resulting in 74.98% of students passing math (a score > 70), 85.81% of students passing reading, and an overall rate of 65.17% for students passing both subjects. The total annual budget for the district was $25 million with an average per student budget of $629.

At the high school level, the passing rate ranged from 65.68% to 94.59% for mathematics, 79.30% to 97.31% for reading, and 52.99% to 91.33% for both subjects. There were 7 district schools and 8 charter schools which varied widely in size and budget, 427 to 4976 students and $248,000 to $3.1 million respectively. The top 5 schools with the highest % of students passing both subjects were charter schools, specifically Cabrera High School, Thomas High School, Griffin High School, Wilson High School, and Pena High School. The bottom 5 schools with the lowest % of students passing both subjects were the following district schools: Rodriguez High School, Figueroa High School, Huang High School, Hernandez High School and Johnson High School.

The math and reading scores were also analyzed by grade, school spending, size and type. The mean score for grades 9 through 12 for both subjects differed by less than 1 indicating consistent scores across grades. Interestingly, the schools with the largest school spending per student had the lowest scores and passing rates for each subject as well as the lowest overall passing rate for both subjects. For schools spending $645 to $680 per student, the overall passing rate was 53.53% as compared to 90.37% for schools spending less than $585 per student. More information on these schools and the students would greatly help understand why less students passed at schools with more spending per student.

When looking at the size of a school, larger schools (2000 to 5000 students) underperformed medium sized schools (1000 to 2000 students) which outperformed small schools (less than 1000 students). Their overall passing rates were 58.29%, 90.62% and 89.88%. It is important to note that the low overall passing rate for large schools was primarily due to math with a passing rate of 69.96% as opposed to 82.77% for reading.  In terms of school type, district schools performed significantly lower (overall passing rate of 53.67%) than charter schools (90.43%). As with the low rate for large schools, the passing rate of 66.55% for math contributed to the low overall performance for district schools.

Additional information and analysis are needed but overall, there appears to be a relationship between the 3 factors (school size, spending, and type) and the math and reading scores and resulting passing rates. It would be interesting to look at the combinations of these factors as well as other characteristics of these schools (such as services provided, student assignment/enrollment, budget allocation). Looking at more characteristics of the students in relation to their scores and passing rates would also be beneficial.
